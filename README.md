# Scandiweb Junior React Dev Test Project

This is an assignment project for a junior React dev role in Scandiweb.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for the Scandi devs üëã

A feedback was provided to take care of the dangersouslySet innerHTML. By the time I polished the assignment based on the feedback, I did not quite understand where should I look into to take care of the issue. I generally sanitize user Input from the backend with PHP. During working on another project I found the useCase of sanitization in the client-side. 

With this said, I probably would go and change the `product description`'s description to `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={_html: content }>` or use other libs for that. Plz correct me if I am wrong since, you know how it is, always learning. üôÇ

## My takes

Below is the explanations of how I approached to solve various problems I faced during the development phasee.

## COMPONENT strucutre

- Maintained core React reusability concept as much as possible.
- This is not it and things can always be updated to a much better version.

## Tech used

- JSX
- React-router
- Sass
- Redux-toolkit
- GraphQL
- Apollo-client

## Things that are challenging for this project

All of these challenges are tackled down without any third-party libs.

- Finding and rendering content from deeply nested data structure.
- Maintaining dynamicity of the application.
- Implementing heavy algorithms required to achieve certain conditions and functionality.
- and more.

## Advance proejct consideration

I have not taken care of the optimization since it was not mentioned in the project description provided. If i had to take care of the optmization I would use a combination of `PureComponent` and `shouldComponentUpdate` depending on the use case. If i was to use `shouldComponentUpdate`, I would manually compare the `nextProps` with `this.props` or `nextState` with `this.state` and so on. If something else would require to optimize more, I would go to such extent to take care of the optimization.

## Available Scripts
