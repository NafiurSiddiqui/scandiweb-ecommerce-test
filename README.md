# Scandiweb Junior React Dev Test Project

This is a assignment project for junior dev role in Scandiweb

## My takes

Below is the explanations of how I approached to solve various problems I faced during the development phasee.

### CATEGORY

- If this was a large scale project, I would dynamically fetch the category and render the category title as header instead of hard coding data here.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
